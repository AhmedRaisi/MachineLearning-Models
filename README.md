# Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This repository is a collection of various machine learning models implemented from scratch. The primary goal is to explore and understand the underlying mathematics and algorithms that power these models. By building these models without relying on high-level libraries, we gain a deeper insight into their mechanics and use cases.

## Models in This Repository

### Gaussian Discriminant Analysis Models
- Located in `GaussianDiscriminantModels/`
- Implements Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) models, including versions with class-dependent covariance, class-independent covariance, and diagonal covariance.
- Emphasis on understanding the role of covariance in classification and the mathematical principles behind GDA.

### Kmeans and PCA (Kmeans_PCA)
- Located in `Kmeans_PCA/`
- Demonstrates the application of K-means clustering on raw data and data transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Provides insights into the effects of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.

### Future Models
- This repository will continue to grow with more models, each accompanied by detailed explanations of the math and logic behind them.
- Upcoming models may include:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Neural Networks
  - And more...

## Purpose of the Repository
- The primary purpose is educational, aiming to provide a hands-on approach to learning machine learning.
- Each model is accompanied by in-depth documentation and analysis to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of its workings.

Stay tuned for more updates and additions to this repository!
